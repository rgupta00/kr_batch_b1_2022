It was the hot summer days A crow was suffering
 from thirst and was wandering here and there in the search of water
But even after wandering in many places
he did not get water He was flying too late He was tired due to constant flying Meanwhile his thirst
 was increasing in the scorching heat. Gradually he started losing his patience He started to feel that his end time was near
 Today he will surely be killed.
Now he was not being blown away due to fatigue
 He sat on the branch of a tree to rest for some time.
